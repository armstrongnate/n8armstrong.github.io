The default calendar app on the Watch shows the current month but there is
no way to view previous or upcoming months as one might expect. I am a
[Fantasical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) user and was hoping that with the
release of [their Watch app](https://flexibits.com/fantastical-watch) I would
be getting a full calendar on my wrist but sadly it was not so.

So to scratch my own itch I made [NanoCal](link_to_itunes_here).
