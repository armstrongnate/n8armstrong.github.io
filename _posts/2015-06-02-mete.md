_Mete_ is an iOS app I developed for a school project. I was assigned a client,
[Paul Hill](http://www.paulallenhill.com/) of Utah State University, for whom I would
build an app. His idea was to track the cost of meetings based on the salaries of
the attendees and the duration of the meeting. Attendees can join a meeting via
bluetooth or email and set their salaries, but those salaries are kept private.

You won't find this app in the App Store. It was in TestFlight for a series of builds
and it earned me full credit for my class but I don't plan on submitting it to the
store. Ever. Instead, it will be [on GitHub](https://github.com/n8armstrong/mete) for
all to behold.

## Technologies used

This project was written in Swift and makes use of a few technologies and APIs
that I had been wanting to experiment with. They include:

* CloudKit
* MultipeerConnectivity
* Facebook's [Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop) framework for animations

## Results

Here are a few things I was able to learn from the experience making this app.

### 1. Singleton abuse

I learned about [singleton abuse](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/singletons.html)
the hard way. I was madly in love with singletons when I started this project.
I thought they were the cat's pajamas. Why would I pass an object
from view controller to view controller when I can just do `MyClass.sharedInstance`
from anywhere? Turns out [there are a lot of reasons](http://www.kyleclegg.com/blog/9272013why-singletons-are-bad),
but it was too late. If I were to do it again I would do a lot of things differenty
beginning with ripping out my many singletons.

### 2. CloudKit

This app was going to need data in the cloud and I wanted to try something new. I
do Rails at work, have used [Parse](https://parse.com/) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
for other side projects and
[CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/cloudkit-storage/) was
fairly new and looked interesting so I settled on it.

I might write about CloudKit again later but to summarize, CloudKit is fine. I would
probably prefer to just roll my own rails app and use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
but you get a lot for free with CloudKit which is cool so I guess it just depends on what you're doing.

CloudKit was a great fit for this application from a technical standpoint but probably
not great from a marketable standpoint since Android users would be a big part of
its success. I chose education over _potential_ sales.

### 3. MultipeerConnectivity

These APIs are solid. I had fun with the bluetooth portion of this app and hope
to dabble with MulipeerConnectivity more in the future.

### 4. Pop

Pop is a cool animation framework. You can do a lot for very little. I struggled
with animating multiple views at once and had some troubles using it with custom
segue animations but I'm not totally sure Pop is to blame for that.

### 5. Fancy Inset Views

The original design involved many fancy [inset views](http://localhost:4000/2015/03/18/uiview-inset-effect/)
surrounding text fields and other controls so I put together a custom UIView
subclass [available on GitHub](https://github.com/n8armstrong/fancy-inset-view)
for that very purpose. Funny enough, I caved and switched to a flat and simplistic
design and left the inset views behind but it might come in handy later on.

Eventhough _Mete_ will not be on the App Store I feel like it was a win because
I gained a lot of iOS experience making it. It wasn't my first app and it surely
won't be my last.
