title: Hello World
---

My name is Nate. I work for [Custom Bit](http://custombit.com) as a rails/iOS
developer while attending university. I'll graduate at the end of this year with a
bachelor's degree in computer science.

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
I followed [this tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)
pretty closely which introduced me to [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) which I
highly recommend. I am using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme with almost
zero customizations.
