As part of a school assignment I was to build an app for a "client". This was
the client's idea: an iPhone app that calculates the cost of a meeting
based on the salaries of attendees. Host a meeting and attendees can join
either by bluetooth or by email and can enter their salary anonymously to
get the most private yet accurate calculation of time and money spent during
meetings.

Instead of putting the app on the App Store I made the repo public on GitHub.
It could still use some polish and I didn't want to get into a rights war with
my so-called client.
