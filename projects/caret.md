I wanted to make an iOS app for my Senior Project so I decided on Caret
because I knew I would end up using it. Caret is a time tracking software
that Custom Bit is developing in-house. Since the API was already in place
I decided to make a mobile client for it.

Caret uses CoreData, Alamofire, CoreLocatation, MapKit, WatchKit, and several other frameworks
and libraries including a drop-in [CalendarView](https://github.com/n8armstrong/CalendarView)
that I made.
