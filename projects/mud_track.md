Mud Track is an Enterprise iPad application made for Mud Engineers working on oil
rigs. Here is a snippet of its description from the company website:

> Mud engineers can now monitor the mud readings from a distance, update parameters
> for mud weight and viscosity. Changes will update in real time on all other
> tablets assigned to the rig to keep everybody on the same page. The Mud Track
> software also uses a record tape which appears on the home screen. Users can
> keep up with how the rig is operating by simply monitoring the tape.

I wrote the iOS app and also helped with the Rails API. I used Swift,
[RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit) for the network layer,
CoreGraphics for the mud tape, and Storyboards/AutoLayout throughout.
