At the time that I took an Android Development course in college my current
employer used [MinuteDock](https://minutedock.com/) for tracking time on our
software projects. MinuteDock had a nice api but no native apps and I was in need
of a project for my class so this app was born.

It is in serious need of an update but for a while there a few of my
coworkers were using it regularly to clock their time.

It was a great way for me to get a feel for Android development and a dive
into the Java programming language.
